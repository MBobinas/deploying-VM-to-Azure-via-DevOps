<h1>Deploy a VM to Azure using an Azure DevOps Pipeline (from an ARM template)<h1>

<h3>
This document demonstrates the process of deploying a virtual machine (VM) to Azure using an Azure DevOps pipeline with an ARM template. By following the steps outlined below, you will be able to create a pipeline, define an ARM template for VM deployment, and successfully deploy the VM into Azure.
<h3>

<h3>Prerequisites<h3>

* Azure DevOps account
* Access to an Azure subscription
* Basic knowledge of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates
Steps

### 1. Create a code repository

* Choose your preferred tool, either Azure DevOps Repos or GitHub, to create a code repository.
* Set up the repository with an appropriate name and initialize it.

### 2. Create an Azure DevOps pipeline for VM deployment

* In Azure DevOps Pipelines, create a new pipeline.
* Select your code repository as the source for the pipeline.
* Choose the appropriate template or define a pipeline from scratch.
* Configure the pipeline to trigger on changes to the repository.

### 3. Create an ARM template for VM deployment

* Develop an ARM template that describes the resources required for VM deployment. This should include the VM itself as well as any necessary dependencies.
* Ensure that the template includes the necessary parameters, such as VM size, storage account settings, network configuration, etc.

### 4. Push the ARM template to the code repository

* Push the developed ARM template to the code repository you created in step 1.
* Make sure the template is placed in an appropriate location within the repository.

### 5. Review the pipeline run
* Trigger a pipeline run in Azure DevOps Pipelines by making changes to the code repository or manually triggering the pipeline.
* Monitor the pipeline run for any errors or warnings.
* Investigate and resolve any issues that may arise during the deployment process.
### 6. Update the ARM template and redeploy the VM
* Modify the ARM template to change the VM size or make any other desired modifications.
* Push the updated ARM template to the code repository.
* Trigger a new pipeline run to redeploy the VM with the updated configuration.
## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the deployment of a virtual machine to Azure using an Azure DevOps pipeline and an ARM template!
